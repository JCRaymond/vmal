# VMAL
This repository holds the reference implementation for VMAL, an assembly language for the Vertical Microarchitecture discussed in ITSC 3181 at UNC-Charlotte.

## Requirements
All of the code for VMAL is contained within VMAL.py, which requires Python 3.5 or greater (tested on 3.5 and later, it might work on earlier versions of python) as well as the package `lark-parser` which can be installed with pip:
```bash
pip install --user lark-parser
```
